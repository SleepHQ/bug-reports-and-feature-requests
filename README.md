# Bug Reports and Feature Requests

This is a place for users of the SleepHQ platform to submit technical bug reports and feature requests.

If you know what you're doing, submit an issue with the details of the bug or feature.
Please try to be as descriptive as possible.
Things like: 
- Links to specific pages within the app
- Screen shots marked up with changes
- Detailed steps to reproduce errors

all help us to quickly resolve issues.

We'll triage and add things to our backlog as appropriate.

We'll also do our best to use the issues to report back to you when features/fixes are deployed.

Please just remember, right now we're a team of two people (only one a developer) doing our best to build out a platform that will help as many people as possible.

Thanks for helping us to continue to improve SleepHQ.

With your help, we're going to continue building out the best platform possible!
